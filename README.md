## Usage

```bash
Usage: wadump [-r] [--outgoing] [-m <message>]

CLI Tool to dump WhatsApp Packets

Options:
  -r, --reset       reset the saved session and clear the keys
  --outgoing        is this message outgoing? (i.e you are the sender)
  -m, --message     a base64 message to be decrypted and dumped, if not provided
                    it will try to read it from stdin
  --help            display usage information
```

In the first usage, it will ask you about the `Encryption Key` and `MAC Key` and will be stored in your OS Keychain, if you don't want to use the Keychain
you could also set the `WADUMP_ENC_KEY` and `WADUMP_MAC_KEY` environment variables and it will use them instead (even if there are keys stored in the keychain)

## FAQ

1. How do I get my `Encryption Key` and `MAC Key`?

- Well, that is super easy open [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com/) then open the Browser Developer Tools (Hit F12)
  And then from there go to the `Application` tab and select `Storage` > `Local Storage` and select the `WASecretBundle`.
  Copy the `encKey` and `macKey` values and paste them when the program prompt for them, they are stored localy in your OS Keychain.

2. How to View Ongoing and Outgoing Messages?

- If you read FAQ #1 you alrady know how to open the Browser Developer Tools, now go to `Network` tab and Filter by `WS` (i.e Websocket)
  if it is not visable, try to refersh the page and you will see a ws entry, click on it from there you could click on the `Messages` tab.
  now you could see the incomming and the outgoing messages.
  Click in anyone of them and then by default it will view it as Hex Dump, change the `Hex Viewer` value to `Base64` and there will be a little copy icon too.

3. How could I ...
